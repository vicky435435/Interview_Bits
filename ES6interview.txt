1. What is the spread operator in ES6?
Spread operator is used to obtain the list of parameters. It is represented by three dots (…).
Basically spread operator takes an iterable (such as array or string) and expands it into individual elements. 
In JavaScript, it is mainly used to make shallow copies of JS. It makes your code concise and increases the readability of your code.

2. Explain Promises in ES6.

In JavaScript, there is a concept of asynchronous programming. In asynchronous programming,
you run the processes individually from the main thread. In ES6 promises are the easiest way to deal with asynchronous programming.
A promise can either be rejected or resolved depending on the operation outcome. 
Before promises were introduced in ES6, callbacks were used to deal with asynchronous programming.


3. What is the purpose of template literals in ES6?
Template literals are the strings with code embedded and having variables inside.
 We can interpolate and concatenate using template literals more comprehensively than the previous versions of ES.


 4 . What is meant by the Arrow function?
ES6 arrow function is used for defining and using a function. It is Arrow functions’ shorthand notation. The parameter list (….) can be passed to the arrow function.
 And a => marker, as well as function body, follows it. Parentheses are not needed when the arrow function is declared with a single argument
