This is a basic question to ensure that you understand MongoDB's role as a NoSQL document database.

Explain the difference between a relational database and MongoDB.
Highlight the key distinctions between MongoDB (a NoSQL database) and traditional relational databases, such as schema, data model, and scalability.

What is a BSON?
BSON (Binary JSON) is the binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents used by MongoDB. It's a format that allows MongoDB to represent complex data structures.

What is a document in MongoDB?
In MongoDB, a document is a JSON-like data structure composed of field-value pairs. Documents are the basic unit of data in MongoDB and are analogous to rows in a relational database.

Explain the concept of a collection in MongoDB.
A collection in MongoDB is a group of MongoDB documents. It's similar to a table in a relational database.

How does indexing work in MongoDB?
Indexing is crucial for performance in MongoDB. Explain the concept of indexes, how they are created, and how they impact query performance.

What is sharding in MongoDB?

What is the purpose of the _id field in a MongoDB document?
The _id field is a mandatory field in every MongoDB document. It serves as a unique identifier for the document within a collection.

Differentiate between findOne() and find() in MongoDB.
findOne() returns a single document that satisfies the specified query criteria, while find() returns a cursor to the documents that match the query criteria.

Explain the aggregation framework in MongoDB.
The aggregation framework in MongoDB provides powerful data aggregation and transformation operations. Understand how to use stages like $match, $group, and $project in aggregation pipelines.

What is the role of the mongod process?
mongod is the primary daemon process for the MongoDB system. It manages data requests, manages data storage, and performs other tasks.

How does MongoDB ensure high availability?
MongoDB ensures high availability through features like replication. Explain the concept of replica sets and how they contribute to high availability.

What is the WiredTiger storage engine?
WiredTiger is the default storage engine for MongoDB starting from version 3.2. It provides support for document-level concurrency control, compression, and more.

Explain the concept of capped collections in MongoDB.
Capped collections are fixed-size collections that maintain insertion order. Once a collection reaches its maximum size, older documents are removed to make space for new ones.

How does MongoDB handle transactions?
MongoDB supports multi-document transactions starting from version 4.0. Explain how transactions work in MongoDB and when they should be used.
