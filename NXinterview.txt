Question 1: Can you explain the concept of Nx libraries in Angular development?

Answer:
Nx libraries are reusable units of code that encapsulate specific functionality in an Angular project.
They can include components, services, or utilities and are created to promote code organization, modularity, and code-sharing across different applications within a monorepository.
Nx allows developers to create, manage, and share libraries effectively, contributing to a scalable and maintainable codebase.

Question 2: Walk me through the process of creating a new Nx library in an Angular project.

Answer:
To create a new Nx library, I would use the following command:
nx generate @nrwl/angular:library my-library
