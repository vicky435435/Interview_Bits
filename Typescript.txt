1. What is TypeScript ?

Object-oriented language: TypeScript supports all features of the object-oriented language, such as classes, modules, interfaces, etc. 
Both for client-side and server-side development, code written.

TypeScript can run in any environment that JavaScript runs on.
It is portable across operating systems, browsers, and devices.


2. Explain the difference between let, const, and var in TypeScript.

let and const are block-scoped, while var is function-scoped. Additionally, const is used for declaring constants, and variables declared with it cannot be reassigned.
