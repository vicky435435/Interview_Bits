Explain the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript.
Answer:
var: Function-scoped, can be redeclared and reassigned. Variables will be hoisted
let: Block-scoped, can be reassigned but not redeclared. Hoisted but not initialized
const: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

What is var, let, and const?

var is function-scoped, while let and const are block-scoped. const cannot be reassigned.


1 Difference between let and var ?

The difference between let and var is in the scope of the variables they create: 
Variables declared by let are only available inside the block where they're defined. 
Variables declared by var are available throughout the function in which they're declared

2 What is promise in javascript 

A Promise can be in one of three states:

Promises provide a cleaner and more flexible alternative to traditional callback functions for handling asynchronous code.

Pending: The initial state; the promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.

Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.

Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.

3. what is hosting in javascript ?

Variable Hoisting:
In JavaScript, variable declarations are hoisted to 
the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. 
However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations

4 What is callback function ?

In JavaScript, you can also pass a function as an argument to a function. 
This function that is passed as an argument inside of another function is called a callback function.

          aur -->
In JavaScript, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another 
function and is executed after the completion of a specific task.

What is callback function and normal function in JavaScript?
What is a Callback Function in JavaScript? | 
    => 
A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution.
A more formal definition would be - Any function that is passed as an argument to another function
so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.


5. What is MAP () in JavaScript?
Description. map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. 
map() does not execute the function for empty elements. map() does not change the original array.

6. closure.
In JavaScript, we need closures when a variable which is defined outside the scope in reference is accessed from some inner scope.

AUR ==>

The closure is a primary mechanism to private the data items. Closures give access to the outer function’s scope from the inner function's scope. Closures are created for every function in JavaScript. To define a closure,
 create a function inside another function to expose it.

7.What is meant by NULL in JavaScript?
If no value has been given to the variable then, it is called a null object (or) null value.

8. What is undefined and null in JavaScript?
Undefined means a variable has been declared but has yet not been assigned a value. Null is an assignment value.
It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value


9 . What is filter () in JavaScript?
Description. The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function. The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements.
The filter() method does not change the original array.

10 .  What is ‘this’ keyword in JavaScript?
‘This’ keyword refers to the object from where it was called.

11 . What is the use of the Push method in JavaScript?
The push method is used to add or append one or more elements to an Array end. 
Using this method, we can append multiple elements by passing multiple arguments.

13 Explain the concept of arrow functions in JavaScript.
- **Answer:** Arrow functions are a concise syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. 
They have a shorter syntax, don't have their own `this` binding (they inherit `this` from the enclosing scope), and cannot be used as constructors.


12.  sort( )
This method is used to arrange/sort array’s elements either in ascending or descending order.

13. forEach( )
This method helps to loop over array by executing a provided callback function for each element in an array.

14. slice( )
This method returns a new array with specified start to end elements.

15. shift( )
This method removes the first element from an array and returns that element.

16.  unshift( )
This method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.

17.  join( )
This method returns a new string by concatenating all of the array’s elements separated by the specified separator.

18. filter( )
This method creates a new array with only elements that passes the condition inside the provided function.

19. map( )
This method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array.

20. reduce( )
This method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array to reduce it to a single value.

 How does the localStorage differ from sessionStorage in JavaScript?
 - **Answer:**
  - `localStorage`: Persists data with no expiration date. Data will not be deleted when the browser is closed.
  - `sessionStorage`: Persists data only for the duration of the page session. Data is deleted when the browser tab or window is closed.

21. What is the event loop in JavaScript?

The event loop is a core concept in JavaScript that handles asynchronous operations. 
It continuously checks the call stack and the message queue, pushing functions onto the call stack when the stack is empty.

22.  What is the difference between "==" and "===" in JavaScript?

== is the equality operator, which performs type coercion, 
meaning it converts operands to the same type before making the comparison.

=== is the strict equality operator, which does not perform type coercion and checks both value and type.


23. What is an IIFE, and why might you use it in JavaScript?

Answer: An IIFE is a function expression that is immediately invoked after its creation.
It is often used to create a private scope for variables, preventing them from polluting the global scope and providing a way to encapsulate code.

24. What are the types of loops in JavaScript?

Answer: JavaScript supports several types of loops, including for, while, do-while, and the newer for...of and for...in loops.

25. Explain the difference between for and while loops in JavaScript.

Answer: The for loop is typically used when the number of iterations is known, while the while loop is used when the condition for termination is based on a true/false statement.

26. What is a await in javascript ?

In JavaScript, the await keyword is used in conjunction with the async function to handle asynchronous code in a more synchronous and readable manner.
The await expression causes the async function to pause and wait for the Promise to settle, and then resumes and returns the resolved value.

27. What is setInterval in JavaScript?
setInterval() is a function in JavaScript that is used to repeatedly execute a given function at a specified interval.
 It takes two arguments: the first argument is the function to be executed,

28. What is difference between setTimeout and setInterval in JavaScript?

The setTimeout() method is used to call a function after a certain period of time. 
The setInterval() Javascript method is used to call a function repeatedly at a specified interval of time. 
setTimeout() is cancelled by clearTimeout() method, and setInterval() is cancelled by clearInterval() method.

29. What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage.

LocalStorage is the same as SessionStorage but it persists the data even when the browser is closed and reopened(i.e it has no expiration time) 
whereas in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends.


30. What are the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage

Local storage : client-side only , until deleted,  Not supported for SSL

Session storage : client-side only , until tab is closed, Not supported for SSL

Local storage: It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.

Session storage: It stores data for one session and the data is lost when the browser tab is closed.

31 What is the difference between null, undefined, and NaN in JavaScript?

null = is an explicit assignment of no value.
undefined = means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.
NaN = stands for "Not a Number" and occurs when an operation cannot result in a valid number.


32 What is hoisting?
Hoisting moves function and variable declarations to the top of the scope before execution.

33 What is a closure?
Closure is when an inner function has access to the outer function's variables even after the outer function has returned.

34 find() Method

The find() method is used to find the first element in an array that satisfies a given condition.
It returns that element, or undefined if no element is found.

35. What is the difference between find and filter in JavaScript? 

find: Returns the first element in the array that satisfies the condition. 
If no element matches, it returns undefined

filter: Returns a new array containing all elements that satisfy the condition.
If no elements match, it returns an empty array.
